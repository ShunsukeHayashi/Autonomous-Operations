THEORETICAL FOUNDATION

This project is inspired by organizational management theory and hierarchical
system design principles commonly used in modern software architecture and
autonomous systems.

The implementation follows well-established patterns for:
- Clear responsibility allocation
- Delegation of authority in autonomous agents
- Hierarchical coordination structures
- Result-based evaluation systems
- Elimination of ambiguity through structured workflows

These are general organizational design principles applied to software systems.
