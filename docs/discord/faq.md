## üîß Technical Questions

### What are the system requirements?

To use Miyabi, you need:
- **Node.js 18+** (LTS recommended)
- **Git** (version control)
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** - for GitHub integration
- **GitHub account** - to host repositories
- **Claude Code** (optional, but recommended for advanced features)

### How do I install Miyabi?

```bash
# Quick start - Create new project
npx miyabi init my-project

# Or install in existing project
cd existing-project
npx miyabi install
```

For detailed instructions, see: [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/ShunsukeHayashi/Miyabi)

### Can I use Miyabi without Claude Code?

**Partially.** Some features work standalone via the Agent SDK, but full autonomous operation requires Claude Code integration.

**Without Claude Code:**
- ‚úÖ CLI commands work
- ‚úÖ Manual agent execution
- ‚úÖ Label management
- ‚ùå Full autonomous mode

**With Claude Code:**
- ‚úÖ Full autonomous execution
- ‚úÖ Worktree-based parallel processing
- ‚úÖ AI-powered code generation

### What's the difference between `miyabi` (CLI) and `miyabi-agent-sdk`?

- **`miyabi` (CLI)**: Command-line tool for project setup and management
- **`miyabi-agent-sdk`**: Library for building custom agents programmatically

**Usage:**
```bash
# CLI - For end users
npx miyabi init my-project

# SDK - For agent developers
npm install miyabi-agent-sdk
```

### How do I report a bug?

1. **Search existing issues** on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ShunsukeHayashi/Miyabi/issues)
2. If not found, create a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - System info (OS, Node version, etc.)
3. Or report in **#bug-reports** on Discord

### Where can I find documentation?

- **GitHub Docs**: https://github.com/ShunsukeHayashi/Miyabi/tree/main/docs
- **NPM Package**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/miyabi
- **Discord #tutorials**: Step-by-step guides from the community

## ü§ñ Agent Questions

### What are agents in Miyabi?

**Agents** are autonomous AI workers that handle specific tasks:

- **CoordinatorAgent**: Task decomposition and orchestration
- **CodeGenAgent**: AI-driven code generation (uses Claude)
- **ReviewAgent**: Code quality checking (static analysis, security)
- **IssueAgent**: GitHub Issue analysis and labeling
- **PRAgent**: Pull Request creation
- **DeploymentAgent**: CI/CD automation
- **TestAgent**: Automated testing

### Can I create my own agents?

Yes! Use the `miyabi-agent-sdk`:

```typescript
import { BaseAgent } from 'miyabi-agent-sdk';

class MyCustomAgent extends BaseAgent {
  async execute(task) {
    // Your custom logic here
  }
}
```

Check out the [Agent Development Guide](https://github.com/ShunsukeHayashi/Miyabi/tree/main/docs) for details.

### How do agents decide what to do?

Agents follow the **53-label system** based on organizational design principles:
- **STATE labels**: Track lifecycle (`pending` ‚Üí `analyzing` ‚Üí `implementing` ‚Üí `done`)
- **AGENT labels**: Assign responsibility (`agent:codegen`, `agent:review`, etc.)
- **PRIORITY labels**: Determine execution order (`P0-Critical` ‚Üí `P3-Low`)

For full details: [Label System Guide](https://github.com/ShunsukeHayashi/Miyabi/blob/main/docs/LABEL_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### `npx miyabi init` fails with authentication error

**Solution:**
1. Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` (Mac) or [download](https://cli.github.com/)
2. Authenticate: `gh auth login`
3. Ensure your token has `repo` and `workflow` scopes
4. Try again: `npx miyabi init my-project`

### Labels aren't being created

**Possible causes:**
- GitHub token lacks `repo` scope
- Repository doesn't exist
- Network issues

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check token permissions
gh auth status

# Manually create labels
gh label create "üì• state:pending" --color E4E4E4
```

Or ask in **#installation-issues** for help!

### Agent isn't executing my Issue

**Check:**
1. Does the Issue have a `state:pending` label?
2. Is the repository configured with `.miyabi.yml`?
3. Are GitHub Actions enabled?
4. Check Actions tab for error logs

Still stuck? Ask in **#help** with:
- Issue number
- Repository name
- Error messages (if any)
