## 🛡️ Moderation Policy

### Warning System

We use a **three-strike system**:

1. **First Offense**: Verbal warning from moderators
2. **Second Offense**: Temporary mute (24 hours)
3. **Third Offense**: Temporary ban (7 days)
4. **Severe/Repeated**: Permanent ban

**Note**: Severe violations (hate speech, doxxing, illegal content) may result in immediate permanent ban.

### Reporting Issues

If you see rule violations:

1. **Use Discord's Report Feature**: Right-click message → Apps → Report to Discord
2. **Notify Moderators**: Ping `@Moderator` in `#mod-requests` (not in public channels)
3. **DM a Moderator**: For sensitive issues, DM any online moderator

**Do NOT**:
- ❌ Publicly call out rule violations (avoid "mini-modding")
- ❌ Engage with trolls or escalate conflicts
- ❌ Take matters into your own hands

### Appeal Process

If you receive a warning or ban:

1. **Wait 24 hours** to cool off
2. **DM a Moderator** (not in public channels) to discuss
3. **Provide context** and acknowledge the issue
4. **Show commitment** to following rules going forward

Appeals are reviewed case-by-case. Moderator decisions are final.
